print('One night we thought we heard knocking on the side of the house')

print('''My partner and her 19 year old daughter decided to each get a weapon of choice as I stood back watching this entire scene take place. They both crept to the garage door to make sure the garage was shut. As soon as they opened the door I jumped out and screamed, and scared the living daylights out of both of them. I thought it was hilarious, but they were not very enthralled by my prank. It was probably because they were both holding a weapon and almost went after me when I screamed, hehe. Luckily there wasn't anyone there and no one was injured.''')
